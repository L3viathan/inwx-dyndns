# python-inwx-xmlrpc: A Python class to simplify and leverage the communication with the XML-RPC API of InterNetworX via Python.

## Project Information

This software (python-inwx-xmlrpc) provides an easy way to use the XMLRPC API
offered by InterNetworX to its customers.
The software consists of a class to leverage the use of the API
and example code to show how to use it.

If you have an idea for the software or want to report a bug, let me know via
email!

## Required Python modules

This project uses the standard python modules time, xmlrpclib, hashlib, ConfigParser and sys.

## Installation and Usage

The software is tested and known to work on Python 2.7.1 on Mac OS X 10.6.7.
It should, however, work on any operating system that supports python.

Please refer to my blog post, where I presented the class:
